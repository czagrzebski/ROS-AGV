# DC Motor Encoder Research (Not Finished)


## Overview
 A DC motor encoder is a device that is used to measure the speed and position of a direct current motor. It typically consists of a sensor that is attached to the motor shaft, which generates pulses as the shaft rotates. These pulses are converted into a digital signal that can be read by a control systems, allowing the motor's speed and position to be monitored and controlled. 

 There are two main types of motor encoders
    
    1. Absolute encoders: Gives a unique digital code for each distinct position of the motor shaft ,allowing the exact position of the shaft to be determined at any time. Often used where precise position is required, especially in robot or machine tool applications
    2. Incremental Encoders: An incremental encoder generates a series of pulses as the motor rotates, with the frequency of the pulses proportional to the speed of the shaft. This encoder does not provide absolute position measurement, but rather provides information about the change in position over time. Often used in applications where speed and relative position are more important than absolute position, such as conveyors or positioning stages.

Encoders can be analog or digital, and can use various technology to detect shaft rotation, including optical, magnetic, and capacitive sensors. 

This project does not need absolute positioning, thus we will be using incremental encoders. This will allow us to determine velocity, positioning, and orientation of the robot. We can also implement a PID Controller for optical control of the speed of the robot given the feedback of the encoder.

## Brief PID Control Explanation

The output of the PID control circuit, $u(t)$, is given as:

$u(t) = K_pe(t)+K_i\int_{0}^{t}e(t)dt + K_p\frac{de}{dt}$

Where $K_p$ = Proportional Gain, $K_i$ = Integral Gain, $K_d$ = Derivative Gain, $r(t)$ is the set point, $y(t)$ is the measured process variable, and $e(t) = r(t) - y(t)$. The constants can be tuned for a more stable controller. See the PID research document for more information (Not yet complete). 

For example, our y(t) could be the actual speed of our RC car, while the set point would be our desired speed. Our e(t) would be our error for our speed and the PID control will calculate a new set point to achieve the desired result. 

## Calculate direction and speed of DC motor using an Encoder

Using the signals generated by the Encoder, we can calculate the relative direction and speed of the DC motor.
