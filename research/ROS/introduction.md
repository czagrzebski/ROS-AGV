# Introduction to Robot Operating System (ROS)

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a open-source set of software libraries and tools that help you build robotic applications. ROS provides drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms along with powerful developer tools. There are packages for computing trajectory, conduct SLAM algoirhtms, remote control, and much more.  

ROS is not a true operating system since it runs on top of Ubuntu, a linux based distribution. However, it is more like a middleware that provides a core with communication tools and a set of plug & play libraries.
